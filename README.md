# mananamanana.com website

After 20+ years, mananamanana.com moves to Github, Jekyll, and all that, and away from the hand-crafted html and spacer.gifs of yore. We still don't jetpacks but, hey, we have markdown files and Github actions at least. Automagical website!

The long-dormant front page has been migrated to a Jekyll blog, based on [{ Personal } Jekyll Theme](https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/). Also transformed is [/ohpiglet](https://ohpiglet.mananamanana.com), continuing to chart the lives of the three monkeys and a woodland creature of the forest floor that we found up a tree. Originally a Tumblr, then a WordPress, and now a Jekyll blog.

## My changes

* Orangeified it, of course.
* I've simplified the menu nav bar to be more old-school - direct links, no if statements.
* Removed a bunch of stuff I don't need.
* Dark mode yo!

## How to run locally

Install jekyll and dependencies:

```shell
./scripts/install
```

Build locally:

```shell
./scripts/serve-production
```

View locally:

## RSS feed

The RSS feed is automatically generated and placed in /feed.xml.

## Sitemap

The Sitemap is automatically generated and placed in /sitemap.xml.

## Create a new blogpost

Run the script with the file name of the post as an argument:

```shell
./scripts/newpost hello-world
```

A new post template with name YYYY-MM-DD-hello-world.md will be created under ./_posts, with the current date. Update the title, edit/delete tags, etc. Oh, and add some content.

## Add an image to a blogpost

Images for a new blogpost should be added to the /img/YYYY folder.

In the .md file call the image with this syntax:

```shell
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/YYYY/image-name.jpg" alt="alt text.">
```

## Generate tag pages

```shell
./scripts/generate-tags
```

## TODO

Due date is beginning of September 2024...

### From Rebecca

Contact lenses
Tolstoy book
Writing
Llavorsí
The woman from the supermarket
Queen on the plaza
Error as a parenting strategy
Error as a partnering strategy
Duelling short stories
I am a cliché
Bag of courgettes
The mountain spring
Transitions
Desire
Take away the elements of non importance
How would you write it
I have written nothing for 52 years
Dynamite the tunnel
Aggressive impulses.
Clean the kitchen
Feelings are what you feel
Use glasses
Don't use glasses
What would Rebecca do
What would Saoirse do
Waterfalls
Writing as engineering
Economy of family
Do we need doors
Psychology of small animals
Psychology of small children
Psychology of insects
Insecurity
Resistance
Remember winter
Assemble the children
Just work
The centre is outside
Baby steps
Post orgasmic tickles
Fold down the pages
Listen in the garden
Would anybody read it
I am the rhythm, I am the beat
Critical velocity
Unpaid On call
The gaps between thoughts
Why not
Orange is a sound
The hairdresser who now works in the supermarket is a hypochondriac
The meditation bench beside the vegetation patch
The river runs low
